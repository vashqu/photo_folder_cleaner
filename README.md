# ðŸ§¹ Image Cleanup Pipeline

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that helps you automatically clean up folders of images.  
It combines duplicate detection with AI-powered classification (OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model) to flag unwanted images such as screenshots, memes, tickets, and product photos, while keeping personal photos like portraits, selfies, and travel shots safe.

## âœ¨ Features
- Detects duplicate images using fast MD5 hashing.
- Classifies images with OpenAI CLIP using natural text prompts.
- Supports both **delete categories** (e.g., memes, screenshots, tickets) and **keep categories** (e.g., portraits, selfies, landscapes).
- Previews up to 3 sample images per category with similarity scores before any deletion.
- Uses progress bars (`tqdm`) and summary reports for clarity.
- Safely moves flagged images into a `trash/` folder instead of deleting permanently.
