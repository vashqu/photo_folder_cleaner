    "# Image Cleanup Pipeline (with CLIP + Duplicate Detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a pipeline to **clean up a folder of images** by detecting duplicates and classifying them with OpenAI’s CLIP model. The goal is to safely separate \"junk\" images (e.g., screenshots, memes, tickets) from \"keep\" images (e.g., personal photos, travel pictures).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run it you need to put the notebook in the same folder as the images you are cleaning up. Recommended to verify manually as the model may make mistakes.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Duplicate Detection\n",
    "- Uses **MD5 hashing** to detect identical image files.\n",
    "- The first copy of an image is kept, and duplicates are flagged.\n",
    "- Duplicates are reported but not deleted at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CLIP Classification (Preview Stage)\n",
    "- Combines **delete categories** (e.g., memes, screenshots, tickets) and **keep categories** (e.g., portraits, selfies, landscapes).\n",
    "- Each image is embedded with CLIP and compared to text prompts.\n",
    "- Images are classified into the category with the **highest similarity score**.\n",
    "- Threshold (default `0.25`) ensures only strong matches are considered.\n",
    "- Up to **3 sample images per category** are displayed with confidence scores for manual review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Summary Report\n",
    "- Counts of how many images were flagged for each category (both delete + keep).\n",
    "- Helps decide which categories to actually move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Deletion Stage\n",
    "- User specifies which **delete categories** should be moved.\n",
    "- Selected images (and duplicates) are moved into a `trash/` folder (never permanently deleted).\n",
    "- Progress is tracked with **tqdm progress bars**.\n",
    "- Final summary shows how many images were moved per category and in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Features\n",
    "- **Safe by design**: nothing is permanently deleted; everything goes to `trash/`.\n",
    "- **Preview before delete**: you see flagged images before deciding.\n",
    "- **Customizable categories**: you can tune the prompts and threshold.\n",
    "- **Cross-platform**: works with Apple Silicon (MPS), CUDA GPUs, or CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Notes\n",
    "- CLIP is powerful but not perfect — borderline images may need manual checking.\n",
    "- Prompts matter: natural, descriptive prompts (like `\"a phone screenshot of an app\"`) improve accuracy.\n",
    "- Raising the threshold (e.g., `0.30`) reduces false positives.\n"
